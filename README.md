# DOTFILES

Trying to organize shell environments and tools to work well when
jumping between OSX, Ubuntu, RHEL, Raspberian, etc.

I prefer a minimalist approach so am building my env up instead of
taking another repos entirely as is.  

Obvious influencers:
 - mathiasbynens
 - zachholman
 - paulirish
 - simonowen
 - smashwilson
 - and all those that they've built on

## First Time Install

  $ git clone https://github.com/j12y/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  $ cd ~/.dotfiles
  $ ./bootstrap.sh

There are some additional setup.sh for osx, python, etc. that
can be run to setup a brand new host.
